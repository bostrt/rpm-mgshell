## Bash Completions

This directory contains bash completion scripts for mgshell installed via RPM. These scripts were initially generated using Python Click (<https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/bashcomplete/>) but they evolved slightly as I found Click couldn't account for some possibly awkward setup in mgshell (the fact that bash scripts wrap python and the completion data is generated by python).

## Adding new command completion 

I've included a short helper script to quickly add new bash completion to this repository:

~~~
$ ./gen-cmd-completion.sh test
Created mgshell-test.sh
~~~

It will copy the template file `mgshell-cmd.sh.template` to a new file and `sed` replace the necessary locations.

### And then...

Make sure you update the RPM `.spec` with the new completion file!
